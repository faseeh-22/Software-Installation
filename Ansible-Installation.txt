Installing Ansible on Ubuntu

Ubuntu builds are available in a PPA here.

To configure the PPA on your system and install Ansible run these commands:

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt install ansible


NOTE: If you don't have "ansible config" and "ansible host" files then, use this link: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/examples/ansible.cfg
And if you don't have "sshd" then use this command "sudo apt install openssh-server"
 

==> Ansible Installation on Ubuntu:
> sudo apt update
> sudo apt install software-properties-common
> sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
> sudo apt update
> sudo apt install ansible
> ansible --version
Step -1:
==> Go to hosts file inside ansible server and paste private-ip of node.
> nano /etc/ansible/hosts
[demo]
192.168.10.15
Step -2:
> nano /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg            --> Uncomment these lines.
....
#inventory  = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
#sudo-user  = root
Step -3:
==> Create One User in all hosts machines(Node)
> adduser ansible              --> Create user.
> passwd ansible               --> Set Password.
> su - ansible                 --> For switch in user ansible.
Step -4:
==> Give sudo privilages to ansible user.
> visudo
....
root     ALL=(ALL)  ALL
ansible  ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD: ALL             --> Add this line under the root for give all privilages.
:: Do this with all other nodes.
Step -5: Now Establish connection between server at Node do this changes at all machines.
==> nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config          --> Do some changes in this file.
#PermitRootLogin           Yes         --> Uncomment it.
#PasswordAuthentication    Yes         --> Uncomment it.
#PermitEmptyPasswords      NO
#PasswordAuthentication    No          --> Comment it.
~ Save it. Now do same changes at all nodes.
> Service sshd restart
Step -6: Now verify in ansible server.
> su - ansible
> ssh ip_address   --> Node1 ip.
:: Now it will ask for password so do passwordless Authentication.
Step -7: Password less Authentication.
> ssh-keygen       --> This will create pub. priv.key
> ls -a            --> O/P   :   .ssh
> cd .ssh          --> O/P   :   id_rsa   id_rsa_pub
> ssh-copy-id ansible@ip_address              --> Write private ip of the machine which you want to access.
> cd ..
> ssh ip_addres                     --> Node ip.
:: Now, you will enter into node without password.
