1) Install kubectl binary with curl on Linux

Download the latest release with the command:
   
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"



2) Validate the binary (optional)

Download the kubectl checksum file:

curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256"

Validate the kubectl binary against the checksum file:

echo "$(cat kubectl.sha256)  kubectl" | sha256sum --check

If valid, the output is:

kubectl: OK

If the check fails, sha256 exits with nonzero status and prints output similar to:

kubectl: FAILED
sha256sum: WARNING: 1 computed checksum did NOT match

Note: Download the same version of the binary and checksum.



3) Install kubectl

sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl



4) Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date:

kubectl version --client

Or use this for detailed view of version:

kubectl version --client --output=yaml

kubectl version



Additional Step (Optional)              (NOTE: The first paragraph is very important to read)


5) Verify kubectl configuration

In order for kubectl to find and access a Kubernetes cluster, it needs a kubeconfig file, which is created automatically when you create a cluster using kube-up.sh or successfully deploy a Minikube cluster. By default, kubectl configuration is located at ~/.kube/config.

Check that kubectl is properly configured by getting the cluster state:

kubectl cluster-info

If you see a URL response, kubectl is correctly configured to access your cluster.

If you see a message similar to the following, kubectl is not configured correctly or is not able to connect to a Kubernetes cluster.

The connection to the server <server-name:port> was refused - did you specify the right host or port?

For example, if you are intending to run a Kubernetes cluster on your laptop (locally), you will need a tool like Minikube to be installed first and then re-run the commands stated above.

If kubectl cluster-info returns the url response but you can't access your cluster, to check whether it is configured properly, use:

kubectl cluster-info dump
